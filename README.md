# Godot Scene Manager

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Beta Version:** This plugin is currently in beta and under active development. Features may change, and bugs may be present. We greatly appreciate your feedback! Please report any issues on our [GitHub Issues page](httpss://github.com/esdg/GodotSceneManager/issues).

**Visually design your game's scene flow.** Godot Scene Manager is a powerful plugin that adds a graph editor for managing scene transitions and relationships. Stop writing boilerplate code and start designing your game's structure with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

<!-- 
**TODO:** Replace this image with a GIF of the plugin in action!
A good GIF would show:
1. Right-clicking to add a couple of scene nodes.
2. Dragging to connect them.
3. Selecting a transition from the dropdown.
4. Maybe showing the game run with that transition.
