# Scene Manager Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Godot Scene Manager plugin. These guides help you visually design scene flow, switch scenes via signals, and add polished transitions ‚Äî all in a structured, low-code workflow.

## What is Scene Manager?

A visual scene flow editor for Godot 4 (.NET) that lets you:
- Design your game/app flow as a graph (schema)
- Connect your scene signals to navigation targets
- Play built-in or custom transitions between scenes
- Let an autoload singleton handle runtime switching

Key features:
- Visual schema editor (in the `Scene Manager` tab)
- Signal-driven navigation (you control when to switch)
- Built-in transitions library + custom transition support
- Autoload runtime (`ScenesManagerController`) wires things up automatically
